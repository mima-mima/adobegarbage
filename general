here's the wrong way to import all installers sequentially into Munki after downloading, putting into a common directory, and CRITICALLY unquarantining with `xattrs -c -r`

`OIFS=$IFS;IFS=$'\n';for file in `find Downloads/adobe -name "*_Install.pkg"`; do; echo "file = $file"; munkiimport --unattended_install --unattended_uninstall -c=testing --developer="Adobe" $file; done;IFS=$OIFS`
